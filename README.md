# Oretracker

Combines various tech to allow advanced mining operations.

## What's in the box

* Orehud: The original Oretracker mod with a single command to toggle the mod on or off per individual player.
* Xray: Based on Orehud except trackes non-ores and makes them appear invisible.

### Planned features for both mods

* Require a priviledge for both mods to prevent every player from using all features. (Perhaps you allow your regulars only orehud but not xray)

## Orehud

Displays ore positions via the player's HUD.

> `/orehud` toggles the rendering of the ore positions on or off.

## Xray (Comming Soon)

Hides unwanted stone (and other varients) from view, only showing a empty node in it's wake.

> `/xray` toggles the unwanted stone from visible to invisible (on or off).

### To be done

* Use the pre-existing orehud code in a seperate mod for tracking stone (including varients).
* Make replacement nodes that are "invisible" with a general category feature (light grey for stone, dark red for netherrack, etc.)\*
* When wished to be on, swap nodes in the detect range from their visible to invisble counterparts.

\* I need to make invisible counterparts for all varients so you still get the original resource.
